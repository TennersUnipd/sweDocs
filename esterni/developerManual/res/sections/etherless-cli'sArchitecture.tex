\section{Etherless-cli architecture}
\subsection{The architecture}
The Etherless-cli is the client component that communicates with the AWS applications and the smart contract in the Ethereum network.
This component is made with TypeScript and complied upon execution in Javascript ES6.
The interaction with the program happens through the command-line interface.
At the start of the execution, the program instantiates every class and processes the request made by the user.
To simplify the component, we divided it into two modules, Network Entities, and Command Entities.

\subsection{The Network Entities}
We designed the architecture of NetworkEntities with interoperability and ease of use in mind.
We based the architecture on a \textbf{facade design pattern} that should expose at the user all the functionalities
of the network through the use of specific interfaces without binding to a specific library for communication
with the Ethereum network.
\subsubsection{Architecture overview}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./res/img/NetworkFacade.png}
	\caption{Architecture overview diagram of Network Entities}
\end{figure}
The Network Entities module is made by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{NetworkFacade}: This is the class that defines the main object that the Command Entities interact with, and its the main responsible for communicating with the network;
    \item \textbf{SessionInterface}: This interface defines all the method that every Session object needs to implements to be used in the NetworkFacade, this class include all the method needed to let the user interact with the network ad example login and sign a transaction;
    \item \textbf{ContractInterface}: This interface defines all the method that every Contract object needs to implements to be used in the NetworkFacade, as such as expose the smart contract functionalities and catch signals from it;
    \item \textbf{NetworkInterface}: This abstract class defines the method needed for communication with the Ethereum network and the AWS APIs;
    \item \textbf{NetworkUtils}: This class is a collection of static methods needed for instantiating all the object in NetworkEntities, and keeps all the instances single and defined.
\end{itemize}
The Network Entities module should not expose the constructor of any classes.
The correct way to interact and instantiate the NetworkFacade class is through the static method getNetworkFacadeInstance from NetworkUtils,
this method instantiates our implementation of SessionInterface, ContractInterface, NetworkInterface, and uses them to instantiate the network facade.
\subsubsection{Pros}
This architecture has a good separation of external behavior and internal implementation,
allowing the developers to use any Ethereum network library, creating independence between every component.
\subsubsection{Cons}
This architecture has one major downside, it is difficult to add functionalities without accessing the NetworkFacade and the etherlessContract; We should consider the use of the \textbf{command design pattern} to solve this issue.
Another disadvantage is that if a new developer need a new functionality from any of the interfaces every implementation should reflect the new definition.
\subsubsection{Method}
\paragraph{NetworkFacade}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{signup}: provides the functionality or registration to the service;
    \item \textbf{logon}: provides the logon service; 
    \item \textbf{logout}: discards the user credential;
    \item \textbf{getListOfFunctions}: returns the list of all available contract's methods;
    \item \textbf{callFunction}: calls the methods from the Ethereum component, all requests to the smart contract goes through this method;
    \item \textbf{getListOfFunctions}: retrieves the list of the available Contract's methods;
    \item \textbf{createFunction}: uploads on the AWS endpoint the required function and register it on the eth network;
    \item \textbf{getAllLoadedFunction}: retrieves all the functions loaded on the smart contract;
    \item \textbf{getFunctionDetails}: retrieves from the smart contract the details about the requested function;
    \item \textbf{getCostOfFunction}: retrieves from the smart contract the cost of a specific function loaded on the service;
    \item \textbf{runFunction}:runs a remote function;
    \item \textbf{disconnect}: disconnects the application from the network.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{SessionInterface}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{signup}: provides the signup functionality;
    \item \textbf{logon}: provides the logon functionality using already existing credentials;
    \item \textbf{logout}: discards the credentials;
    \item \textbf{signTransaction}: signs the provided transaction;
    \item \textbf{isUserSignedIn}: checks that the user is logged;
    \item \textbf{getUserAddress}: retrieves the user address;
    \item \textbf{getBalance}:retrieves the balance from the account.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{ContractInterface}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{getListOfFunctions}: retrieves all the available contract's methods;
    \item \textbf{getArgumentsOfFunction}: returns all the parameter required to run the requested function;
    \item \textbf{isTheFunctionPayable}: 
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Command Entities}
We base the CommandEntities component on the Command abstract class that is a kind of command design pattern, this means that to add any command to the CLI the developer needs to extend the Command class and implements the exec method.
The Command's constructor exposes the dependency from NetworkFacade using this kind of approach lets us work with mocks and separate the two components of the CLI.
\subsubsection{Architecture overview}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./res/img/CommandEntities.png}
	\caption{Architecture overview diagram of Command Entities}
\end{figure}
The Command Entities modules is made by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Command}: This is the main class that all *Command Class should extend because defines the base behavior of every command class;
    \item \textbf{Commander}: This class is a collection of static methods needed to interact with the external library Commander and wraps it, exposing functionalities for adding a new command in the available one.
\end{itemize}
We implemented the basic command functionalities, extending the class abstract class Command:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SignUpCommand}: This class implements the sign-up command and allows the user to interact with the Ethereum network for the creation of a new user;
    \item \textbf{LogonCommand}: This class implements the logon command and allows the user to save his credential and use his already existing account;
    \item \textbf{LogoutCommand}: This class implements the logout command and allows the user to delete hid credential;
    \item \textbf{ListCommand}: This class implements the list command and allows the user to interrogate the smart contract and read the list of deployed function;
    \item \textbf{CreateCommand}: This class implements the create command and allows the user to upload in the system a new function to be executed through our service;
    \item \textbf{RunCommand}:This class implements the run command and allows the user to run a deployed function through our service, and moves the credit from his account to our and the function owner.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Pros}
This architecture has good expandability about the functionalities because if a developer wants to add a new function should only extend the command class and insert it in the list of function.
\subsubsection{Cons}
The way we used to instantiate all the classes is not elegant, because we use a method that reads from a list of all the classes that need to instantiate.
