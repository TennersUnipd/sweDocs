The platform is managed and maintained by the Administrators. 
Developers can deploy Javascript functions into the platform. Users, finally, can run those functions provided they pay the fees set by the developers. Such fees are partially held by the platform itself as a compensation for the expenditure of the actual function execution.\\
As an example, Marvin, a developer, wants to provide a postal code' lookup (PCL) service. Given a postal

burdensome. He therefore decides to deploy it on Etherless, which, on top of the Serverless
