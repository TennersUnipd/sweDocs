\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose of the document}
This document is the developer manual for Etherless, a project developed by Tenners based on Ethereum infrastructure, and it has the purpose to detail the components of the software and illustrate to the maintenance the installation process.

\subsection{Purpose of the product}
Etherless is a Cloud Application Platform which allows developers to deploy Javascript functions in the cloud and let pay final users for their execution (e.g. Computation-as-a-service, CaaS), by leveraging the ethereum's smart contract technology. Developers can deploy Javascript functions into the platform. Users, finally, can run those functions provided they pay the fees set by the developers. Such fees are partially held by the platform itself as a compensation for the expenditure of the actual function execution.

\subsection{Glossary}
At the end of this document there is the appendix A where you can find the definitions of terms that may be ambiguous or new to the user of Etherless. These terms are marked with a subscript G (e.g. example\glos).
